# Pollarity

Pollarity takes data gleaned from state-wide and national polls, and visualizes them in a more digestible format through the use of charts, maps, and bar graphs. The timeline scroll-bar on maps show averages of poll data at different time intervals, while charts and bar graphs illustrate changes in public opinion over the course of months and years.

Using linear regression, cluster analysis, and machine learning, we have also ventured into the fickle world of preditions on one topic, President Obama's approval rating. To accomplish this, we analyzed trends in his past approval rating, correlated with the S&P500 index.
