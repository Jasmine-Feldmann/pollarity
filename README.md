# [Pollarity](http://pollarity.herokuapp.com/)

Pollarity takes data gleaned from state-wide and national polls, and visualizes them in a more digestible format through the use of charts, maps, and bar graphs. The timeline scroll-bar on maps show averages of poll data across the US at different time intervals, while charts and bar graphs illustrate changes in national public opinion over the course of months and years.

Using linear regression, cluster analysis, and machine learning, we have also ventured into the fickle world of predictions. To begin with, we focused on only one topic, President Obama's approval rating. To generate this predictions, we analyzed trends in his past approval rating from 2010 onwards, correlated with weekly closing prices on the S&P500 index.
